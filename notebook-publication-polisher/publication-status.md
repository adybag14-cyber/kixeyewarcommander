# Publication Status

## 2026-05-10 assessment

- Overall state: the attached executed notebook package was reviewed directly and a corrected polished copy was rebuilt at `/workspace/output/P201_201698955_publication_ready_polished.ipynb`.
- Current best deliverable: `/workspace/output/P201_201698955_publication_ready_polished.ipynb`.
- Readiness summary: the polished copy now opens and closes on the real quantitative result: `111 of 225` retained traces, solvent order `Acetonitrile > Acetone > THF > Cyclohexane > Toluene`, and a `46.5-fold` fastest-to-slowest solvent span.
- Visual and rendering summary: the notebook still contains 19 stored HTML outputs and 2 inline GIF embeds; the second GIF panel no longer opens by default in the saved output state; and notebook-level CSS now protects wide stored tables against horizontal clipping in notebook and HTML views.

## Major issues resolved this run

- Rebuilt a real polished notebook deliverable in `/workspace/output` rather than leaving the notes pointing at a missing file.
- Strengthened the title-card result statement, abstract and conclusion so the notebook presents one consistent quantitative story from start to finish.
- Corrected the remaining source/output interpretation drift in the results and post-lab sections so the notebook no longer claims acetone is the fastest accepted solvent.
- Added explicit bootstrap-rank evidence to the results discussion and conclusion, using the executed rank table to support the stability of the acetonitrile-first ordering.
- Closed the saved laboratory-workflow GIF panel by default in both the source-side HTML generator and the stored rendered HTML output.
- Added notebook-level horizontal-scroll protection for stored HTML tables to reduce clipping risk in notebook and exported HTML views.

## Major remaining blockers

- A clean end-to-end rerun is still blocked in this container because the original scientific notebook stack is not installed here.
- Final publication sign-off still depends on one rerun in a complete Jupyter and scientific Python environment to confirm that regenerated outputs remain visually clean, text-consistent and free of new layout defects.
- The attached notebook in `agent_files/` remains the audited source package, while the corrected publication-ready copy for sharing now lives in `/workspace/output`.

## Next highest-value actions

1. Re-run `/workspace/output/P201_201698955_publication_ready_polished.ipynb` in a complete scientific notebook environment with the required dependencies installed.
2. Re-check regenerated figures, tables and both GIF panels for any clipping, overlap, open-by-default behaviour or prose drift introduced during rerun.
3. Do one final micro-polish pass focused only on captions, output sizing and any regenerated text that changes during execution.
